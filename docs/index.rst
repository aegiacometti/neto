Welcome to Network Orchestra's documentation!
=============================================

Yes yes, I know... I'm very very original with the name of this project! ;)

Anyway, after +20 years in a network enterprise environment, I got tired of having to learn different command lines each
time a vendor decides to put something new on the market, and of course, management platforms that only work with
their devices, but the new ones! because the old one "you need to replace them"... you all know this story.

And don't get me wrong... I love to learn, in fact, if I am not learning something new, I behave like a kid who doesn't
have something to play with, for me, this is a kind of work but with passion.

So, I decided to start "playing" with all of these new toys and in the way I found my self wanting to start a developing
path to integrate networking and coding worlds. I already kind of know about networking, ok, now let's go to the
developing/programming world with words like: Linux, Python, Pycharm, Ansible, SaltStack, event-bus, git, gitHub,
markdown, reStructuredText, auto-documentation, readTheDocs, TinyDB, Tox, Jenkins, Napalm, and every day two new toys...

This project aims to make it easier to play with the network, and excuse me if I offend someone, but since I enjoy this
so much, sometimes I like to use the word "play" instead of "work". My objective is to use this compilation of tools
in a personal way, for your PC, for your use, nothing commercial nor enterprise.

You will see amazing things that can be done in the OpenSource environment without having to marry any vendor. The
community out there is amazing... Enjoy!
