#List the full content of the DB specified in the configuration file ``netor.conf``, unless a full path name
#to different TinyDB database is specified as an argument.

#Verify existence of ``netor.conf`` file, since it could be required by the confparse module in order to get
#the DB full path name.

#example:
#    ``../netor/tinydb/scripts/listdb.py /full/path/name/database.json``

#Also has an export function to dump the current DB to a ``.csv`` file. If you want to export another DB you will
#need to ``netor-db-switch`` first.

#example:
#      ``../netor/tinydb/scripts/listdb.py -e``
